        Repbot asks brand for their budget and negotiates on your behalf if we
        think their offer is too low. We use a holistic approach to negotiation
        that takes into account your minimum rate, social metrics, and data from
        past deals across all creators using Repbot. However, brands are still
        in control of their offer at the end of the day - our goal in
        negotiation is simply to advocate for fair pay.

        Repbot exists so that you never have to sign with a manager that will
        take 15% of your business in exchange for barely managing your email
        inbox. But if better representation comes along, we want you to take it.
        No fees. No contractural obligations or early exist clauses. We see
        ourselves as a stepping stone to an agency that will help you with
        outbound, hiring, and product development if that's the route you choose
        to go with your business.
