          No more wasting time scouring the internet trying to see if a company
          or product is legit. And if you never want to see another affiliate
          deal in your life, hiding them is just a click away.

          <code>Repbot</code> automatically negotiates higher rates from brands

          Brands can still submit offers below industry standard and you can
          still take them - our goal in negotiation is simply to advocate for
          fair pay.
