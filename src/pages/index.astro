        No more wasting time scouring the internet trying to see if a company or
        product is legit. And if you never want to see another affiliate deal in
        your life, hiding them is just a click away.

        <code>Repbot</code> automatically negotiates higher rates from brands on
        your behalf. You tell us your minimum rate and social stats, and we'll
        use previous deal data to get you the best offer possible.

        Brands can still submit offers below industry standard and you can still
        take them - our goal in negotiation is simply to advocate for fair pay.
