            Our goal is for Repbot to be completely free to use with no paid add
            ons or usage tiers. However, giving away stuff for free does not
            make for financial sustainability, and we want to make sure you can
            rely on Repbot to help you run your business for a long time.

          <p className="mb-3">
            To that end, our plan for monetization (at the moment) is to sell
            anonymized, aggregate reports on the sponsorship industry to brands
            and other talent agencies based on the data that Repbot collects
            about the deals that come through the service.
